## Facial Keypoints Detection with CNN

- */src* -> contains the code
- */data* -> contains the data used in our experiments

There are 3 files in the */src* folder.

- *detect.py* contains all the code for training and evaluatng the CNN model
- *predict.py* contains code for making keypoint predictions on a couple of images from a dataset.
- *model.h5* -> contains the weights of the trined CNN model.

To make a couple of predictions and plot predicted keypoints on the image, just run the *predict.py* file.
The execution might take a couple of seconds for the dataset and network weights to load.
